# PhD-thesis
LaTeX files for my PhD Thesis. Currently a WIP.


### Compilation
I used TeXstudio on Ubuntu 18.04.5 to compile this.
These are the configurations that work.
 - Configure > Build > Build & View
     `txs:///pdflatex | txs:///biber | txs:///pdflatex | txs:///pdflatex`
 - Configure > Build > Default Bibliography Tool
     `Biber`
 - Bibliography > Type 
     `BibLaTeX`
