	abstract = "Synonymous mutations do not alter the protein produced yet can
	have a significant effect on protein levels. The mechanisms by
	which this effect is achieved are controversial; although some
	previous studies have suggested that codon bias is the most
	important determinant of translation efficiency, a recent study
	suggested that mRNA folding at the beginning of genes is the
	dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation. Using
	the\textit{Escherichia coli}and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes,
	we conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the
	determinants of translation efficiency. There is a significant
	association between codon bias and translation efficiency across
	all endogenous genes in E. coli and S. cerevisiae but no
	association between folding energy and translation efficiency,
	demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important determinant
	of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does modulate
	the strength of association between codon bias and translation
	efficiency, which is maximized at very weak mRNA folding (i.e.,
	high folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between
	the genomic profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of
	folding energy across mRNA, suggesting that lower folding
	energies slow down the ribosomes and decrease translation
	efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces act near
	uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of
	genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous
	genes, folding energy affects translation efficiency in a global
	manner that is not related to the expression levels of individual
	genes, and thus cannot be detected by correlation with their
	expression levels.",

	within the window. The candidate sequences are assessed with a

	abstract = "v0.9.0 (July 2018) Note: a version of these release notes with
	working links appears in the online documentation. This is a
	major release with several substantial and long-desired new
	features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and
	color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0
	and some notable API changes. New relational plots Three
	completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot,
	scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface
	to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The
	functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the
	seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots
	(scatter plots and line plots). These functions can visualize a
	relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to
	three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or style
	semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently
	in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in
	scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in
	lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is
	dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the
	variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the
	matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
	Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn
	functionality is that they have better support for using numeric
	variables for hue and size semantics. This functionality may be
	propagated to other functions that can add a hue semantic in
	future versions; it has not been in this release. The lineplot
	function also has support for statistical estimation and is
	replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is
	marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better
	aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible
	in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying
	the size and style semantics independently. It also has
	substantially improved support for date and time data, a major
	pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more esoteric
	options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a
	colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been
	implemented in the new function. There is quite a bit of new
	documentation that explains these new functions in more detail,
	including detailed examples of the various options in the API
	reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions should be
	considered in a ``stable beta'' state. They have been thoroughly
	tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The
	main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has
	been implemented. There are planned improvements to some
	elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little
	rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the
	default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may
	change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes and
	palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style
	themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim
	of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent
	with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of
	the new style parameters for better implementation of some
	aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:
	Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context
	parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib
	2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new
	parameterss in the ``style'' spec while moving parameters that
	used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the ``context''
	spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of
	having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That
	means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in
	different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of
	the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include
	only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are
	stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want
	to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the
	matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the seaborn palettes
	(``deep'', ``muted'', ``colorblind'', etc.) to correspond with
	the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now
	available at ``deep6'', ``muted6'', ``colorblind6'', etc.
	Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better
	consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility. Calling
	color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative
	palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer
	qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib
	tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will
	return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some
	palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it
	did in previous versions. Enhanced color\_palette to accept a
	parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a
	string, prefixed with ``ch:'' (e.g. ``ch:-.1,.2,l=.7''). Note
	that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using
	only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by
	appending ``\_r'', as with other matplotlib colormaps. This
	specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a
	palette= parameter. Slightly increased the base font sizes in
	plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for ``talk''
	and ``poster'' contexts. Calling set will now call
	set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by
	default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had
	changes to their default parameters. The factorplot function has
	been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original
	R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent
	with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change
	should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should
	make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and
	will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may
	be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as
	possible. The other reason that the factorplot name was changed
	was to ease another alteration which is that the default kind in
	catplot is now ``strip'' (corresponding to stripplot). This plots
	a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place
	to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The
	old default style in factorplot (``point'', corresponding to
	pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical
	estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot.
	The ``letter-value'' terminology that was used to name the
	original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did
	not help anything. The new name should make the plot more
	discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes,
	also known as ``boxen''). As with factorplot, the lvplot function
	still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition. Renamed
	the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects
	(FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that
	use them (factorplot, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid
	conflicts with the size parameter that is used in scatterplot and
	lineplot (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the
	meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the default
	diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a ``hue''
	dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation
	component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be
	removed in a future version. Two older functions that were
	deprecated in earlier versions, coefplot and interactplot, have
	undergone final removal from the code base. Documentation
	improvements There has been some effort put into improving the
	documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the
	library has been completely rewritten to provide much more
	information and, critically, examples. In addition to the
	high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some
	important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the
	distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how
	datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to
	customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have
	been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the
	categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial. Other small
	enhancements and bug fixes Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib
	LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects, providing a big
	speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal plots
	to use scatterplot. (Note that the ``hue'' currently draws three
	separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the
	scatterplot function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot
	with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now
	follows the color cycle, and the function can use color and label
	kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using
	with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws parameter to
	PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in PairGrid
	that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal
	axes. Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now
	accept list inputs. Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single
	row/column level or using col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set
	axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on
	matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends
	that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the install
	infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that
	pip is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now
	work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are
	specified with strict minimal versions. Updated the testing
	infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many
	individual tests still use nose assertion).",

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: A large class of RNA secondary structure prediction
	programs uses an elaborate energy model grounded in extensive
	thermodynamic measurements and exact dynamic programming
	algorithms. External experimental evidence can be in principle be
	incorporated by means of hard constraints that restrict the
	search space or by means of soft constraints that distort the
	energy model. In particular recent advances in coupling chemical
	and enzymatic probing with sequencing techniques but also
	comparative approaches provide an increasing amount of
	experimental data to be combined with secondary structure
	prediction. RESULTS: Responding to the increasing needs for a
	versatile and user-friendly inclusion of external evidence into
	diverse flavors of RNA secondary structure prediction tools we
	implemented a generic layer of constraint handling into the
	ViennaRNA Package. It makes explicit use of the conceptual
	separation of the ``folding grammar'' defining the search space
	and the actual energy evaluation, which allows constraints to be
	interleaved in a natural way between recursion steps and
	evaluation of the standard energy function. CONCLUSIONS: The
	extension of the ViennaRNA Package provides a generic way to
	include diverse types of constraints into RNA folding algorithms.
	The computational overhead incurred is negligible in practice. A
	wide variety of application scenarios can be accommodated by the
	new framework, including the incorporation of structure probing
	data, non-standard base pairs and chemical modifications, as well
	as structure-dependent ligand binding.",

	of miRNA, siRNA or bacterial sRNA to their respective targets.
	Similarly, the accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is
	essential for translation to start in prokaryotes. Furthermore,
	many classes of RNA binding proteins require the binding site to
	be single-stranded. RESULTS: We introduce a way to compute the
	accessibility of all intervals within an RNA sequence in (n3)
	time. This improves on previous implementations where only
	intervals of one defined length were computed in the same time.
	While the algorithm is in the same efficiency class as sampling
	approaches, the results, especially if the probabilities get
	small, are much more exact. CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recombinant protein production is a useful
	biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble
	proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to
	fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli
	(E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors
	varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still
	the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a
	given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they
	assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on
	the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of
	vectors and proteins result in no expression. RESULTS: In this
	study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to
	predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not
	express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further
	predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We
	collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant
	protein production core facility, where six different vectors
	were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both
	training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three
	different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and
	their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models
	consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the
	sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that
	a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no
	expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that
	considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a
	model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of
	the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the
	best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that
	the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the
	best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained
	model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems
	to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.
	CONCLUSION: In this paper, we show that a machine learning
	approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a
	target protein in a recombinant protein production system is
	promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study
	of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other
	labs in the public domain when this paper is published.",

	functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a
	full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of
	colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to
	cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how
	to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of
	smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the
	heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by
	color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information.
	Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a
	matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns
	by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead
	by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword
	argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list
	of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using
	different markers for different hues should let plots be more
	comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when
	printed). See the github pull request for examples. More
	generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and
	PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary
	across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily.
	hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword
	arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of
	levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been
	added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom
	projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added
	two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential
	palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a
	seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated
	variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the
	diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two
	endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial
	for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color
	for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls
	space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the
	seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these
	functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets:
	choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette,
	choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For
	consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to
	choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix
	palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a
	color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that
	object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This
	should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good
	representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this
	notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information.
	Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion
	by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the
	various choices one might make when choosing colors for their
	data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect
	results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default
	index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a
	date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot
	would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either
	the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around
	a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear
	as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2
	arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now
	implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to
	significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric.
	Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value
	used in version 0.4 resulted in very large PDF files.",

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Recombinant protein production is a useful
	biotechnology to produce a large quantity of highly soluble
	proteins. Currently, the most widely used production system is to
	fuse a target protein into different vectors in Escherichia coli
	(E. coli). However, the production efficacy of different vectors
	varies for different target proteins. Trial-and-error is still
	the common practice to find out the efficacy of a vector for a
	given target protein. Previous studies are limited in that they
	assumed that proteins would be over-expressed and focused only on
	the solubility of expressed proteins. In fact, many pairings of
	vectors and proteins result in no expression. RESULTS: In this
	study, we applied machine learning to train prediction models to
	predict whether a pairing of vector-protein will express or not
	express in E. coli. For expressed cases, the models further
	predict whether the expressed proteins would be soluble. We
	collected a set of real cases from the clients of our recombinant
	protein production core facility, where six different vectors
	were designed and studied. This set of cases is used in both
	training and evaluation of our models. We evaluate three
	different models based on the support vector machines (SVM) and
	their ensembles. Unlike many previous works, these models
	consider the sequence of the target protein as well as the
	sequence of the whole fusion vector as the features. We show that
	a model that classifies a case into one of the three classes (no
	expression, inclusion body and soluble) outperforms a model that
	considers the nested structure of the three classes, while a
	model that can take advantage of the hierarchical structure of
	the three classes performs slight worse but comparably to the
	best model. Meanwhile, compared to previous works, we show that
	the prediction accuracy of our best method still performs the
	best. Lastly, we briefly present two methods to use the trained
	model in the design of the recombinant protein production systems
	to improve the chance of high soluble protein production.
	CONCLUSION: In this paper, we show that a machine learning
	approach to the prediction of the efficacy of a vector for a
	target protein in a recombinant protein production system is
	promising and may compliment traditional knowledge-driven study
	of the efficacy. We will release our program to share with other
	labs in the public domain when this paper is published.",

	pharmaceutical research and production yield. For a given
	protein, the extent of its solubility can represent the quality
	of its function, and is ultimately defined by its sequence. Thus,
	it is imperative to develop novel, highly accurate in silico
	sequence-based protein solubility predictors. In this work we
	propose, DeepSol, a novel Deep Learning-based protein solubility
	predictor. The backbone of our framework is a convolutional
	neural network that exploits k-mer structure and additional
	sequence and structural features extracted from the protein
	sequence. Results: DeepSol outperformed all known sequence-based
	state-of-the-art solubility prediction methods and attained an
	accuracy of 0.77 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.55.
	The superior prediction accuracy of DeepSol allows to screen for
	sequences with enhanced production capacity and can more reliably
	predict solubility of novel proteins. Availability and

	abstract = "This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new
	functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying
	clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These
	functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a
	full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of
	colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to
	cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how
	to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of
	smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the
	heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by
	color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information.
	Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a
	matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns
	by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead
	by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword
	argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list
	of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using
	different markers for different hues should let plots be more
	comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when
	printed). See the github pull request for examples. More
	generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and
	PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary
	across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily.
	hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword
	arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of
	levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been
	added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom
	projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added
	two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential
	palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a
	seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated
	variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the
	diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two
	endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial
	for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color
	for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls
	space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the
	seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these
	functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets:
	choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette,
	choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For
	consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to
	choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix
	palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a
	color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that
	object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This
	should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good
	representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this
	notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information.
	Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion
	by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the
	various choices one might make when choosing colors for their
	data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect
	results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default
	index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a
	date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot
	would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either
	the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around
	a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear
	as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2
	arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now
	implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to
	significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric.
	Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value
	used in version 0.4 resulted in very large PDF files.",

Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

RESULTS: We have discovered that global structural flexibility, which can be modeled by normalised B-factors, accurately predicts the solubility of 12,216 recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. We have optimised these B-factors, and derived a new set of values for solubility scoring that further improves prediction accuracy. We call this new predictor the 'Solubility-Weighted Index' (SWI). Importantly, SWI outperforms many existing protein solubility prediction tools. Furthermore, we have developed 'SoDoPE' (Soluble Domain for Protein Expression), a web interface that allows users to choose a protein region of interest for predicting and maximising both protein expression and solubility.

	abstract     = {Spider neurotoxins are commonly used as pharmacological tools and are a popular source of novel compounds with therapeutic and agrochemical potential. Since venom peptides are inherently toxic, the host spider must employ strategies to avoid adverse effects prior to venom use. It is partly for this reason that most spider toxins encode a protective proregion that upon enzymatic cleavage is excised from the mature peptide. In order to identify the mature toxin sequence directly from toxin transcripts, without resorting to protein sequencing, the propeptide cleavage site in the toxin precursor must be predicted bioinformatically. We evaluated different machine learning strategies (support vector machines, hidden Markov model and decision tree) and developed an algorithm (SpiderP) for prediction of propeptide cleavage sites in spider toxins. Our strategy uses a support vector machine (SVM) framework that combines both local and global sequence information. Our method is superior or comparable to current tools for prediction of propeptide sequences in spider toxins. Evaluation of the SVM method on an independent test set of known toxin sequences yielded 96\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Furthermore, we sequenced five novel peptides (not used to train the final predictor) from the venom of the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes to test the accuracy of the predictor and found 80\% sensitivity and 99.6\% 8-mer specificity. Finally, we used the predictor together with homology information to predict and characterize seven groups of novel toxins from the deeply sequenced venom gland transcriptome of S. plumipes, which revealed structural complexity and innovations in the evolution of the toxins. The precursor prediction tool (SpiderP) is freely available on ArachnoServer (http://www.arachnoserver.org/spiderP.html), a web portal to a comprehensive relational database of spider toxins. All training data, test data, and scripts used are available from the SpiderP website.},

	abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, scientific research has been focused on developing peptide/protein-based therapies to treat various diseases. With the several advantages over small molecules, including high specificity, high penetration, ease of manufacturing, peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic molecules against many diseases. However, one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity. Therefore, in the present study, we developed in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins. DESCRIPTION: We obtained toxic peptides having 35 or fewer residues from various databases for developing prediction models. Non-toxic or random peptides were obtained from SwissProt and TrEMBL. It was observed that certain residues like Cys, His, Asn, and Pro are abundant as well as preferred at various positions in toxic peptides. We developed models based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides for predicting toxicity of peptides. The performance of dipeptide-based model in terms of accuracy was 94.50\% with MCC 0.88. In addition, various motifs were extracted from the toxic peptides and this information was combined with dipeptide-based model for developing a hybrid model. In order to evaluate the over-optimization of the best model based on dipeptide composition, we evaluated its performance on independent datasets and achieved accuracy around 90\%. Based on above study, a web server, ToxinPred has been developed, which would be helpful in predicting (i) toxicity or non-toxicity of peptides, (ii) minimum mutations in peptides for increasing or decreasing their toxicity, and (iii) toxic regions in proteins. CONCLUSION: ToxinPred is a unique in silico method of its kind, which will be useful in predicting toxicity of peptides/proteins. In addition, it will be useful in designing least toxic peptides and discovering toxic regions in proteins. We hope that the development of ToxinPred will provide momentum to peptide/protein-based drug discovery (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/).},

These results establish centipedes as currently the only known animals with venoms used in predation and defence that contain multiple gene families derived from horizontal gene transfer. The results also provide the first evidence for the implication of horizontal gene transfer in the evolutionary origin of venom in an animal lineage. Three of the bacterial gene families encode virulence factors, suggesting that horizontal gene transfer can provide a fast track channel for the evolution of novelty by the exaptation of bacterial weapons into animal venoms.},

The most common among them are phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s), enzymes that have two independent evolutionary origins in snake venoms. Within the group II PLA(2)s found in viperid venoms, a particular subgroup emerged, in which the otherwise conserved Asp49 of their catalytic center is replaced by Lys49. These intriguing proteins, referred to as Lys49 myotoxins, lost the ability to catalyze phospholipid hydrolysis, but still induce myonecrosis by a non-enzymatic mechanism based on membrane permeabilization as the critical event. Such mechanism is only partially understood. This review briefly describes the general structural and functional characteristics of the Lys49 myotoxins, and summarizes four proposed models of their functional ``toxic site''. Finally, it discusses some novel insights into their mode of action, in particular examining arguments and experimental observations that could shed light on the possible nature of their membrane target on skeletal muscle cells, which remains elusive.},

We decided to evaluate plastid transformation as an alternative to overcome limitations observed for nuclear transgenic technologies. The advantages include the possibilities to express polycistronic RNAs, to obtain higher protein expression levels, and the impeded gene flow due to the maternal inheritance of the plastome. We transformed Nicotiana tabacum plastids to co-express the tobacco PR proteins AP24 and $\beta$-1,3-glucanase. Transplastomic tobacco lines were characterized and subsequently challenged with Rhizoctonia solani, Peronospora hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina and Phytophthora nicotianae. Results showed that transplastomic plants expressing AP24 and $\beta$-1,3-glucanase are resistant to R. solani in greenhouse conditions and, furthermore, they are protected against P.hyoscyami f.sp. tabacina and P. nicotianae in field conditions under high inoculum pressure. Our results suggest that plastid co- expression of PR proteins AP24 and $\beta$-1,3-glucanase resulted in enhanced resistance against filamentous pathogens.},

	SUMMARY: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering biological
	sequences to reduce sequence redundancy and improve the performance of
	other sequence analyses. In response to the rapid increase in the amount of
	sequencing data produced by the next-generation sequencing technologies, we
	have developed a new CD-HIT program accelerated with a novel
	parallelization strategy and some other techniques to allow efficient
	clustering of such datasets. Our tests demonstrated very good speedup
	derived from the parallelization for up to \sim{}24 cores and a
	quasi-linear speedup for up to \sim{}8 cores. The enhanced CD-HIT is
	capable of handling very large datasets in much shorter time than previous
	versions. AVAILABILITY: http://cd-hit.org. CONTACT: liwz@sdsc.edu

	Synonymous mutations do not alter the protein produced yet can have a
	significant effect on protein levels. The mechanisms by which this effect
	is achieved are controversial; although some previous studies have
	suggested that codon bias is the most important determinant of translation
	efficiency, a recent study suggested that mRNA folding at the beginning of
	genes is the dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation.
	Using the Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes, we
	conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the determinants of
	translation efficiency. There is a significant association between codon
	bias and translation efficiency across all endogenous genes in E. coli and
	S. cerevisiae but no association between folding energy and translation
	efficiency, demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important
	determinant of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does
	modulate the strength of association between codon bias and translation
	efficiency, which is maximized at very weak mRNA folding (i.e., high
	folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between the genomic
	profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of folding energy across
	mRNA, suggesting that lower folding energies slow down the ribosomes and
	decrease translation efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces
	act near uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of
	genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous genes, folding
	energy affects translation efficiency in a global manner that is not
	related to the expression levels of individual genes, and thus cannot be
	detected by correlation with their expression levels.

	of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design.
	These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is
	optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine

	RNA performs a diverse array of important functions across all cellular
	life. These functions include important roles in translation, building
	translational machinery and maturing messenger RNA. More recent discoveries
	include the miRNAs and bacterial sRNAs that regulate gene expression, the
	thermosensors, riboswitches and other cis-regulatory elements that help
	prokaryotes sense their environment and eukaryotic piRNAs that suppress
	transposition. However, there can be a long period between the initial
	discovery of a RNA and determining its function. We present a bioinformatic
	approach to characterize RNA motifs, which are critical components of many
	RNA structure-function relationships. These motifs can, in some instances,
	provide researchers with functional hypotheses for uncharacterized RNAs.
	Moreover, we introduce a new profile-based database of RNA
	motifs--RMfam--and illustrate some applications for investigating the
	evolution and functional characterization of RNA. All the data and scripts

	Much of the information available about factors that affect mRNA decay in
	Escherichia coli, and by inference in other bacteria, has been gleaned from
	study of less than 25 of the approximately 4,300 predicted E. coli
	messages. To investigate these factors more broadly, we examined the
	half-lives and steady-state abundance of known and predicted E. coli mRNAs
	at single-gene resolution by using two-color fluorescent DNA microarrays.
	An rRNA-based strategy for normalization of microarray data was developed
	to permit quantitation of mRNA decay after transcriptional arrest by
	rifampicin. We found that globally, mRNA half-lives were similar in
	nutrient-rich media and defined media in which the generation time was
	approximately tripled. A wide range of stabilities was observed for
	individual mRNAs of E. coli, although approximately 80\% of all mRNAs had
	half-lives between 3 and 8 min. Genes having biologically related metabolic
	functions were commonly observed to have similar stabilities. Whereas the
	half-lives of a limited number of mRNAs correlated positively with their
	abundance, we found that overall, increased mRNA stability is not
	predictive of increased abundance. Neither the density of putative sites of
	cleavage by RNase E, which is believed to initiate mRNA decay in E. coli,
	nor the free energy of folding of 5' or 3' untranslated region sequences
	was predictive of mRNA half-life. Our results identify previously
	unsuspected features of mRNA decay at a global level and also indicate that
	generalizations about decay derived from the study of individual gene
	transcripts may have limited applicability.

	Phenotypic plasticity of microbial cells has attracted much attention and
	several research efforts have been dedicated to the description of methods
	aiming at characterizing phenotypic heterogeneity and its impact on
	microbial populations. However, different approaches have also been
	suggested in order to take benefit from noise in a bioprocess perspective,
	e.g. by increasing the robustness or productivity of a microbial
	population. This review is dedicated to outline these controlling methods.
	A common issue, that has still to be addressed, is the experimental
	identification and the mathematical expression of noise. Indeed, the
	effective interfacing of microbial physiology with external parameters that
	can be used for controlling physiology depends on the acquisition of
	reliable signals. Latest technologies, like single cell microfluidics and
	advanced flow cytometric approaches, enable linking physiology, noise,
	heterogeneity in productive microbes with environmental cues and hence
	allow correctly mapping and predicting biological behavior via mathematical
	representations. However, like in the field of electronics, signals are
	perpetually subjected to noise. If appropriately interpreted, this noise
	can give an additional insight into the behavior of the individual cells
	within a microbial population of interest. This review focuses on recent
	progress made at describing, treating and exploiting biological noise in
	the context of microbial populations used in various bioprocess

	Secondary structure of messenger RNA plays an important role in the
	bio-synthesis of proteins. Its negative impact on translation can reduce
	the yield of protein by slowing or blocking the initiation and movement of
	ribosomes along the mRNA, becoming a major factor in the regulation of gene
	expression. Several algorithms can predict the formation of secondary
	structures by calculating the minimum free energy of RNA sequences, or
	perform the inverse process of obtaining an RNA sequence for a given
	structure. However, there is still no approach to redesign an mRNA to
	achieve minimal secondary structure without affecting the amino acid
	sequence. Here we present the first strategy to optimize mRNA secondary
	structures, to increase (or decrease) the minimum free energy of a
	nucleotide sequence, without changing its resulting polypeptide, in a
	time-efficient manner, through a simplistic approximation to hairpin
	formation. Our data show that this approach can efficiently increase the
	minimum free energy by >40\%, strongly reducing the strength of secondary
	structures. Applications of this technique range from multi-objective
	optimization of genes by controlling minimum free energy together with CAI
	and other gene expression variables, to optimization of secondary
	structures at the genomic level.

	MOTIVATION: As more non-coding RNAs are discovered, the importance of
	methods for RNA analysis increases. Since the structure of ncRNA is
	intimately tied to the function of the molecule, programs for RNA structure
	prediction are necessary tools in this growing field of research.
	Furthermore, it is known that RNA structure is often evolutionarily more
	conserved than sequence. However, few existing methods are capable of
	simultaneously considering multiple sequence alignment and structure
	prediction. RESULT: We present a novel solution to the problem of
	simultaneous structure prediction and multiple alignment of RNA sequences.
	Using Markov chain Monte Carlo in a simulated annealing framework, the
	algorithm MASTR (Multiple Alignment of STructural RNAs) iteratively
	improves both sequence alignment and structure prediction for a set of RNA
	sequences. This is done by minimizing a combined cost function that
	considers sequence conservation, covariation and basepairing probabilities.
	The results show that the method is very competitive to similar programs
	available today, both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018) Note: a version of these release notes with working
	links appears in the online documentation. This is a major release with
	several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also
	updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better
	consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes. New
	relational plots Three completely new plotting functions have been added:
	catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface
	to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring
	the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting
	functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots). These
	functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while
	mapping up to three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or
	style semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in
	the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the
	area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line
	plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you
	pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the
	matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width. Another way the
	relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that
	they have better support for using numeric variables for hue and size
	semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can
	add a hue semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release. The
	lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is
	replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is marked for
	removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the
	rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across
	additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics
	independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time
	data, a major pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more
	esoteric options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped
	KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new
	function. There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new
	functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various
	options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions
	should be considered in a ``stable beta'' state. They have been thoroughly
	tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main
	features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been
	implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly
	the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this
	release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of
	point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes
	and palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes,
	context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes
	was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in
	matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better
	implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the
	changes: Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context
	parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update.
	The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the ``style''
	spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding
	aesthetics to the ``context'' spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are
	now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid
	style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in
	different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots,
	especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support
	for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but
	wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can
	be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the
	seaborn palettes (``deep'', ``muted'', ``colorblind'', etc.) to correspond
	with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now
	available at ``deep6'', ``muted6'', ``colorblind6'', etc. Additionally, a
	few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and
	accessibility. Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named
	qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer
	qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived
	palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors
	in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will
	have a different length than it did in previous versions. Enhanced
	color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix
	palette in in a string, prefixed with ``ch:'' (e.g. ``ch:-.1,.2,l=.7'').
	Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only
	their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending
	``\_r'', as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be
	accepted by any seaborn function with a palette= parameter. Slightly
	increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the
	scaling factors for ``talk'' and ``poster'' contexts. Calling set will now
	call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by
	default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had changes
	to their default parameters. The factorplot function has been renamed to
	catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a
	name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn
	itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and
	it should make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and
	will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be
	removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible. The
	other reason that the factorplot name was changed was to ease another
	alteration which is that the default kind in catplot is now ``strip''
	(corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which
	is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the
	default in relplot. The old default style in factorplot (``point'',
	corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a
	statistical estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot.
	The ``letter-value'' terminology that was used to name the original kind of
	plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did not help anything. The new
	name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it
	plots multiple boxes, also known as ``boxen''). As with factorplot, the
	lvplot function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition.
	Renamed the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid,
	PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them (factorplot,
	lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the size parameter
	that is used in scatterplot and lineplot (necessary to make relplot work)
	and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the
	default diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a ``hue''
	dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation component of
	JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future
	version. Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions,
	coefplot and interactplot, have undergone final removal from the code base.
	Documentation improvements There has been some effort put into improving
	the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the
	library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and,
	critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the
	introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of
	confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level
	functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to
	customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have been made
	throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial
	categorical\_tutorial. Other small enhancements and bug fixes Changed
	rugplot to plot a matplotlib LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects,
	providing a big speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal
	plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the ``hue'' currently draws three
	separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot
	function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables.
	The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and
	the function can use color and label kwargs, adding more flexibility and
	avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws
	parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in
	PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes.
	Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs.
	Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using
	col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve
	auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using
	matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the
	install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that pip
	is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now work in an empty
	environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict
	minimal versions. Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with
	pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

	Despite considerable efforts, no physical mechanism has been shown to

	that interactions between the coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno

	both intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent coupling of
	transcription and translation in E. coli. We further demonstrate that

	sequence through the formation of non-equilibrium secondary structures. By
	contrast, a non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and
	translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous substitutions on
	mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary statistical analysis of the E. coli

	However, recent studies strongly suggest that the efficiency of protein

	synthesis, we employed a library of more than 250,000 reporters combined

	the identity of the amino acids encoded by codons 3 to 5 impact protein
	yield. This effect is independent of tRNA abundance, translation initiation
	efficiency, or overall mRNA structure. Single-molecule measurements of
	translation kinetics revealed pausing of the ribosome and aborted protein
	synthesis on codons 4 and 5 of distinct amino acid and nucleotide
	compositions. Finally, introduction of preferred sequence motifs only at

	BACKGROUND: The accessibility of RNA binding motifs controls the efficacy
	of many biological processes. Examples are the binding of miRNA, siRNA or
	bacterial sRNA to their respective targets. Similarly, the accessibility of
	the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is essential for translation to start in
	prokaryotes. Furthermore, many classes of RNA binding proteins require the
	binding site to be single-stranded. RESULTS: We introduce a way to compute
	the accessibility of all intervals within an RNA sequence in (n3) time.
	This improves on previous implementations where only intervals of one
	defined length were computed in the same time. While the algorithm is in
	the same efficiency class as sampling approaches, the results, especially
	if the probabilities get small, are much more exact. CONCLUSIONS: Our
	algorithm significantly speeds up methods for the prediction of RNA-RNA
	interactions and other applications that require the accessibility of RNA
	molecules. The algorithm is already available in the program RNAplfold of
	the ViennaRNA package.
