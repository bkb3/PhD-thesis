              speed and protein expression. Ribosome profiling experiments have
              underscored that ribosomes do not move uniformly along mRNAs.
              Here, we have modeled this variation in translation elongation by
              using a feed-forward neural network to predict the ribosome
              density at each codon as a function of its sequence neighborhood.
              Our approach revealed sequence features affecting translation
              elongation and characterized large technical biases in ribosome
              profiling. We applied our model to design synonymous variants of
              a fluorescent protein spanning the range of translation speeds
              predicted with our model. Levels of the fluorescent protein in
              budding yeast closely tracked the predicted translation speeds
              across their full range. We therefore demonstrate that our model

              that this information can be harnessed to design coding
              sequences; and that control of translation elongation alone is

              samples using Escherichia coli host vectors. The platform is
              centered on 6X-His affinity-tagged protein constructs, allowing
              for a similar purification procedure for most targets, and the
              implementation of high-throughput parallel methods. In most
              cases, these affinity-purified proteins are sufficiently
              homogeneous that a single subsequent gel filtration
              chromatography step is adequate to produce protein preparations
              that are greater than 98\% pure. Using this platform, over 1000
              different proteins have been cloned, expressed, and purified in
              tens of milligram quantities over the last 36-month period (see

              which this effect is achieved are controversial; although some
              previous studies have suggested that codon bias is the most
              important determinant of translation efficiency, a recent study
              suggested that mRNA folding at the beginning of genes is the
              dominant factor via its effect on translation initiation. Using
              the Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptomes,
              we conducted a genome-scale study aiming at dissecting the
              determinants of translation efficiency. There is a significant
              association between codon bias and translation efficiency across
              all endogenous genes in E. coli and S. cerevisiae but no
              association between folding energy and translation efficiency,
              demonstrating the role of codon bias as an important determinant
              of translation efficiency. However, folding energy does modulate
              the strength of association between codon bias and translation
              efficiency, which is maximized at very weak mRNA folding (i.e.,
              high folding energy) levels. We find a strong correlation between
              the genomic profiles of ribosomal density and genomic profiles of
              folding energy across mRNA, suggesting that lower folding
              energies slow down the ribosomes and decrease translation
              efficiency. Accordingly, we find that selection forces act near
              uniformly to decrease the folding energy at the beginning of
              genes. In summary, these findings testify that in endogenous
              genes, folding energy affects translation efficiency in a global
              manner that is not related to the expression levels of individual
              genes, and thus cannot be detected by correlation with their
              expression levels.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: An important problem in synthetic biology is to
              design a nucleotide sequence of an mRNA that confers a desirable
              expression level of a target protein. The secondary structure of
              protein-coding sequences (CDSs) is one potential factor that
              could have both positive and negative effects on protein
              production. To elucidate the role of secondary structure in CDSs,
              algorithms for manipulating secondary structure should be
              developed. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm for designing a CDS
              with the most stable secondary structure among all possible ones
              translated into the same protein, and implemented it as the
              program CDSfold. The algorithm runs the Zuker algorithm under the
              constraint of a given amino acid sequence. The time and space
              complexity is O(L(3)) and O(L(2)), respectively, where L is the
              length of the CDS to be designed. Although our algorithm is
              slower than the original Zuker algorithm, it could design a
              relatively long (2.7-kb) CDS in approximately 1 h. AVAILABILITY

              protein production has a long tradition, although the optimal

              The most favorable conditions for protein production vary with
              the gene product. Temperature and induction conditions represent
              parameters that affect total protein production, as well as the
              amount of soluble protein. Furthermore, the choice of promoter
              and bacterial strain will have large effects on the production of
              the target protein. In the present study, the effects of three
              different promoters (T7, trc and lacUV5) on E. coli production of
              target proteins with different characteristics are presented. The

              correlated with the amount of soluble protein that is produced.

              BL21(DE3) and Rosetta(DE3), on the expression pattern were

              improving protein production by optimizing translation
              elongation. In these algorithms, it is generally not considered
              how the altered protein coding sequence will affect the secondary
              structure of the corresponding RNA transcript, particularly not
              the effect on the 5'-UTR structure and related ribosome binding
              site availability. This is a serious drawback, because the
              influence of codon usage on mRNA secondary structures, especially
              near the start of a gene, may strongly influence translation
              initiation. In this study, we aim to reduce the effect of codon
              usage on translation initiation by applying a bicistronic design
              (BCD) element. Protein production of several codon-optimized gene
              variants is tested in parallel for a BCD and a standard
              monocistronic design (MCD). We demonstrate that these distinct
              architectures can drastically change the relative performance of

              is indispensable in future studies that aim to reveal the impact

              irrespective of the algorithm used, using a BCD does improve
              protein production compared with an MCD. The overall highest
              expression from BCDs for both GFP and RFP is at least twofold
              higher than the highest levels found for the MCDs, while for
              codon variants having very low expression from the MCD, even
              10-fold to 100-fold increases in expression were achieved by the
              BCD. This shows the great potential of the BCD element for

              enables applications such as codon optimization, RNAi resistant
              genes and protein engineering. Here we introduce a software tool
              that drastically facilitates the design of synthetic genes.
              RESULTS: Gene Designer is a stand-alone software for fast and
              easy design of synthetic DNA segments. Users can easily add, edit
              and combine genetic elements such as promoters, open reading
              frames and tags through an intuitive drag-and-drop graphic
              interface and a hierarchical DNA/Protein object map. Using
              advanced optimization algorithms, open reading frames within the
              DNA construct can readily be codon optimized for protein
              expression in any host organism. Gene Designer also includes
              features such as a real-time sliding calculator of
              oligonucleotide annealing temperatures, sequencing primer
              generator, tools for avoidance or inclusion of restriction sites,
              and options to maximize or minimize sequence identity to a

              efficiency was shown to be inversely proportional to the degree

              Furthermore, it was shown that cap-binding proteins that interact
              with the 5' cap structure (m7GpppN) of eukaryotic mRNAs are

              human cells have become available. A striking finding from these
              studies is that the level of an mRNA typically predicts no more
              than 40\% of the abundance of protein. This correlation
              represents the overall figure for all genes. We present here a
              bioinformatic analysis of translation efficiency - the rate at
              which mRNA is translated into protein. We have analysed those
              human datasets that include genome wide mRNA and protein levels
              determined in the same study. The analysis comprises five
              distinct human cell lines that together provide comparable data
              for 8,170 genes. For each gene we have used levels of mRNA and
              protein combined with protein stability data from the HeLa cell
              line to estimate translation efficiency. This was possible for
              3,990 genes in one or more cell lines and 1,807 genes in all five
              cell lines. Interestingly, our analysis and modelling shows that
              for many genes this estimated translation efficiency has
              considerable consistency between cell lines. Some deviations from
              this consistency likely result from the regulation of protein
              degradation. Others are likely due to known translational control
              mechanisms. These findings suggest it will be possible to build
              improved models for the interpretation of mRNA expression data.

              the bio-synthesis of proteins. Its negative impact on translation
              can reduce the yield of protein by slowing or blocking the
              initiation and movement of ribosomes along the mRNA, becoming a
              major factor in the regulation of gene expression. Several
              algorithms can predict the formation of secondary structures by
              calculating the minimum free energy of RNA sequences, or perform
              the inverse process of obtaining an RNA sequence for a given

              importance of methods for RNA analysis increases. Since the
              structure of ncRNA is intimately tied to the function of the
              molecule, programs for RNA structure prediction are necessary
              tools in this growing field of research. Furthermore, it is known
              that RNA structure is often evolutionarily more conserved than
              sequence. However, few existing methods are capable of
              simultaneously considering multiple sequence alignment and
              structure prediction. RESULT: We present a novel solution to the
              problem of simultaneous structure prediction and multiple
              alignment of RNA sequences. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo in a
              simulated annealing framework, the algorithm MASTR (Multiple
              Alignment of STructural RNAs) iteratively improves both sequence
              alignment and structure prediction for a set of RNA sequences.
              This is done by minimizing a combined cost function that
              considers sequence conservation, covariation and basepairing

              constructing a large-scale library of mutants that differ only in
              the 10 bp preceding the translational start site of a fluorescent

              obtained highly accurate measurements of protein abundance for
              over 2,000 unique sequence variants. The resulting pool spanned
              an approximately sevenfold range of protein levels, demonstrating
              the powerful consequences of sequence manipulations of even 1-10
              nucleotides immediately upstream of the start codon. We devised

              major release with several substantial and long-desired new
              features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and
              color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0
              and some notable API changes. New relational plots Three
              completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot,
              scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface
              to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The
              functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the
              seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots
              (scatter plots and line plots). These functions can visualize a
              relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to
              three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or style
              semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently
              in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in
              scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in
              lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is
              dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the
              variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the
              matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width.
              Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn
              functionality is that they have better support for using numeric
              variables for hue and size semantics. This functionality may be
              propagated to other functions that can add a hue semantic in
              future versions; it has not been in this release. The lineplot
              function also has support for statistical estimation and is
              replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is
              marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better
              aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible
              in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying
              the size and style semantics independently. It also has
              substantially improved support for date and time data, a major
              pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more esoteric
              options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a
              colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been
              implemented in the new function. There is quite a bit of new
              documentation that explains these new functions in more detail,
              including detailed examples of the various options in the API
              reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions should be
              considered in a ``stable beta'' state. They have been thoroughly
              tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The
              main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has
              been implemented. There are planned improvements to some
              elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little
              rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the
              default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may
              change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes and
              palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style
              themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim
              of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent
              with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of
              the new style parameters for better implementation of some
              aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes:
              Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context
              parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib
              2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new
              parameterss in the ``style'' spec while moving parameters that
              used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the ``context''
              spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of
              having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That
              means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in
              different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of
              the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include
              only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are
              stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want
              to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the
              matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the seaborn palettes
              (``deep'', ``muted'', ``colorblind'', etc.) to correspond with
              the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now
              available at ``deep6'', ``muted6'', ``colorblind6'', etc.
              Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better
              consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility. Calling
              color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative
              palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer
              qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib
              tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will
              return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some
              palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it
              did in previous versions. Enhanced color\_palette to accept a
              parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a
              string, prefixed with ``ch:'' (e.g. ``ch:-.1,.2,l=.7''). Note
              that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using
              only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by
              appending ``\_r'', as with other matplotlib colormaps. This
              specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a
              palette= parameter. Slightly increased the base font sizes in
              plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for ``talk''
              and ``poster'' contexts. Calling set will now call
              set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by
              default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had
              changes to their default parameters. The factorplot function has
              been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original
              R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent
              with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change
              should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should
              make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and
              will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may
              be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as
              possible. The other reason that the factorplot name was changed
              was to ease another alteration which is that the default kind in
              catplot is now ``strip'' (corresponding to stripplot). This plots
              a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place
              to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The
              old default style in factorplot (``point'', corresponding to
              pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical
              estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot.
              The ``letter-value'' terminology that was used to name the
              original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did
              not help anything. The new name should make the plot more
              discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes,
              also known as ``boxen''). As with factorplot, the lvplot function
              still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition. Renamed
              the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects
              (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that
              use them (factorplot, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid
              conflicts with the size parameter that is used in scatterplot and
              lineplot (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the
              meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the default
              diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a ``hue''
              dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation
              component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be
              removed in a future version. Two older functions that were
              deprecated in earlier versions, coefplot and interactplot, have
              undergone final removal from the code base. Documentation
              improvements There has been some effort put into improving the
              documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the
              library has been completely rewritten to provide much more
              information and, critically, examples. In addition to the
              high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some
              important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the
              distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how
              datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to
              customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have
              been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the
              categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial. Other small
              enhancements and bug fixes Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib
              LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects, providing a big
              speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal plots
              to use scatterplot. (Note that the ``hue'' currently draws three
              separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the
              scatterplot function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot
              with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now
              follows the color cycle, and the function can use color and label
              kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using
              with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws parameter to
              PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in PairGrid
              that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal
              axes. Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now
              accept list inputs. Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single
              row/column level or using col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set
              axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on
              matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends
              that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the install
              infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that
              pip is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now
              work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are
              specified with strict minimal versions. Updated the testing
              infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many
              individual tests still use nose assertion).",

              programs uses an elaborate energy model grounded in extensive
              thermodynamic measurements and exact dynamic programming
              algorithms. External experimental evidence can be in principle be
              incorporated by means of hard constraints that restrict the
              search space or by means of soft constraints that distort the
              energy model. In particular recent advances in coupling chemical
              and enzymatic probing with sequencing techniques but also
              comparative approaches provide an increasing amount of
              experimental data to be combined with secondary structure
              prediction. RESULTS: Responding to the increasing needs for a
              versatile and user-friendly inclusion of external evidence into
              diverse flavors of RNA secondary structure prediction tools we
              implemented a generic layer of constraint handling into the
              ViennaRNA Package. It makes explicit use of the conceptual
              separation of the ``folding grammar'' defining the search space
              and the actual energy evaluation, which allows constraints to be
              interleaved in a natural way between recursion steps and
              evaluation of the standard energy function. CONCLUSIONS: The
              extension of the ViennaRNA Package provides a generic way to
              include diverse types of constraints into RNA folding algorithms.
              The computational overhead incurred is negligible in practice. A
              wide variety of application scenarios can be accommodated by the

              shown to explain N-terminal codon bias in prokaryotic genomes.
              Using a systematic study of synonymous substitutions in two
              endogenous E. coli genes, we show that interactions between the
              coding region and the upstream Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence
              modulate the efficiency of translation initiation, affecting both
              intracellular mRNA and protein levels due to the inherent
              coupling of transcription and translation in E. coli. We further
              demonstrate that far-downstream mutations can also modulate mRNA
              levels by occluding the SD sequence through the formation of
              non-equilibrium secondary structures. By contrast, a
              non-endogenous RNA polymerase that decouples transcription and
              translation largely alleviates the effects of synonymous
              substitutions on mRNA levels. Finally, a complementary

  abstract = "Objectives Assessing high-sensitivity tests for mortal illness is
              crucial in emergency and critical care medicine. Estimating the
              95\% confidence interval (CI) of the likelihood ratio (LR) can be
              challenging when sample sensitivity is 100\%. We aimed to
              develop, compare, and automate a bootstrapping method to estimate
              the negative LR CI when sample sensitivity is 100\%. Methods The
              lowest population sensitivity that is most likely to yield sample
              sensitivity 100\% is located using the binomial distribution.
              Random binomial samples generated using this population
              sensitivity are then used in the LR bootstrap. A free R program,
              ``bootLR,'' automates the process. Extensive simulations were
              performed to determine how often the LR bootstrap and comparator
              method 95\% CIs cover the true population negative LR value.
              Finally, the 95\% CI was compared for theoretical sample sizes
              and sensitivities approaching and including 100\% using: (1) a
              technique of individual extremes, (2) SAS software based on the
              technique of Gart and Nam, (3) the Score CI (as implemented in
              the StatXact, SAS, and R PropCI package), and (4) the
              bootstrapping technique. Results The bootstrapping approach
              demonstrates appropriate coverage of the nominal 95\% CI over a
              spectrum of populations and sample sizes. Considering a study of
              sample size 200 with 100 patients with disease, and specificity
              60\%, the lowest population sensitivity with median sample
              sensitivity 100\% is 99.31\%. When all 100 patients with disease
              test positive, the negative LR 95\% CIs are: individual extremes
              technique (0,0.073), StatXact (0,0.064), SAS Score method
              (0,0.057), R PropCI (0,0.062), and bootstrap (0,0.048). Similar
              trends were observed for other sample sizes. Conclusions When
              study samples demonstrate 100\% sensitivity, available methods
              may yield inappropriately wide negative LR CIs. An alternative
              bootstrapping approach and accompanying free open-source R

              research reagents and molecular tools frequently depends on
              expression in heterologous hosts. Synthetic genes are
              increasingly used for protein production because sequence
              information is easier to obtain than the corresponding physical
              DNA. Protein-coding sequences are commonly re-designed to enhance
              expression, but there are no experimentally supported design
              principles. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify sequence features
              that affect protein expression we synthesized and expressed in E.
              coli two sets of 40 genes encoding two commercially valuable
              proteins, a DNA polymerase and a single chain antibody. Genes
              differing only in synonymous codon usage expressed protein at
              levels ranging from undetectable to 30\% of cellular protein.
              Using partial least squares regression we tested the correlation
              of protein production levels with parameters that have been
              reported to affect expression. We found that the amount of
              protein produced in E. coli was strongly dependent on the codons
              used to encode a subset of amino acids. Favorable codons were
              predominantly those read by tRNAs that are most highly charged
              during amino acid starvation, not codons that are most abundant
              in highly expressed E. coli proteins. Finally we confirmed the
              validity of our models by designing, synthesizing and testing new
              genes using codon biases predicted to perform well. CONCLUSION:
              The systematic analysis of gene design parameters shown in this
              study has allowed us to identify codon usage within a gene as a
              critical determinant of achievable protein expression levels in
              E. coli. We propose a biochemical basis for this, as well as
              design algorithms to ensure high protein production from
              synthetic genes. Replication of this methodology should allow
              similar design algorithms to be empirically derived for any

              to solving this problem, but has been heavily biased toward the
              study of the effect of 5' transcript regions and to prokaryotes.
              Here, we employ a synthetic biology driven approach that
              systematically differentiates the effect of different regions of
              the transcript on gene expression up to 240 nucleotides into the
              ORF. This enabled us to discover new causal effects between
              features in previously unexplored regions of transcripts, and
              gene expression in natural regimes. We rationally designed,
              constructed, and analyzed 383 gene variants of the viral HRSVgp04
              gene ORF, with multiple synonymous mutations at key positions
              along the transcript in the eukaryote S. cerevisiae. Our results
              show that a few silent mutations at the 5'UTR can have a dramatic
              effect of up to 15 fold change on protein levels, and that even
              synonymous mutations in positions more than 120 nucleotides
              downstream from the ORF 5'end can modulate protein levels up to
              160\%-300\%. We demonstrate that the correlation between protein
              levels and folding energy increases with the significance of the
              level of selection of the latter in endogenous genes, reinforcing
              the notion that selection for folding strength in different parts
              of the ORF is related to translation regulation. Our measured
              protein abundance correlates notably(correlation up to r = 0.62

              allows us to have greater flexibility in gene design for
              recombinant protein expression. Among the various parameters
              considered for such DNA sequence design, individual codon usage
              (ICU) has been implicated as one of the most crucial factors
              affecting mRNA translational efficiency. However, previous works
              have also reported the significant influence of codon pair usage,
              also known as codon context (CC), on the level of protein
              expression. RESULTS: In this study, we have developed novel
              computational procedures for evaluating the relative importance
              of optimizing ICU and CC for enhancing protein expression. By
              formulating appropriate mathematical expressions to quantify the
              ICU and CC fitness of a coding sequence, optimization procedures
              based on genetic algorithm were employed to maximize its ICU

              beneficial effect of three charged amino acids, at least for
              bacterial proteins. In fact, the three most hydrophobic residues
              showed very different correlations with solubility level. Leu
              showed the strongest negative correlation among amino acids,
              while Ile showed a slightly positive correlation in most data

              Notably, Arg correlated with decreased expression and, most
              surprisingly, solubility of bacterial proteins, an effect only
              partially attributable to rare codons. However, rare codons did
              significantly reduce expression despite use of a codon-enhanced

              that contributed by nonrandomness in the use of amino acid pairs,
              which itself is highly evident; it is much weaker when
              nonadjacent codon pairs are examined and virtually disappears
              when pairs separated by two or three intervening codons are
              evaluated. There appears to be a high degree of directionality in
              this bias: any codon that participates in many nonrandom pairs
              tends to make both over- and underrepresented pairs, but
              preferentially as a left- or right-hand member. We show a
              relationship between codon-pair utilization patterns and levels
              of gene expression: genes encoding proteins expressed at high
              levels tend to contain more abundant, but more highly
              underrepresented, codon pairs, relative to genes expressed at low
              levels. The nonrandom utilization of codon pairs may be a
              consequence of their effects on translational efficiency, which

              consensus sequence, using the popular optimization method known
              as simulated annealing. Unlike the conventional approach of
              finding a consensus sequence by first forming a multiple sequence

              the sum of pairwise distances to each of the input sequences. The

              Similarly, the accessibility of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence is
              essential for translation to start in prokaryotes. Furthermore,
              many classes of RNA binding proteins require the binding site to

              accessibility of all intervals within an RNA sequence in (n3)
