\section{Abstract}
Recombinant protein production is a key process in generating proteins of interest in the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research. However, about 50\% of recombinant proteins fail to be expressed in a variety of host cells. To address this problem, we have modified up to the first nine codons of messenger RNAs with synonymous substitutions and showed that protein levels can be tuned. These modifications alter the ‘accessibility’ of translation initiation sites. We have also revealed the dynamics between accessibility, gene expression, and turnovers using a coarse-grained simulation.

\section{Introduction}
Recombinant protein expression has numerous applications in biotechnology and biomedical research. Despite extensive refinements in protocols over the past three decades, half of the experiments fail in the expression phase (http://targetdb.rcsb.org/\\metrics/). Notable problems are the low expression of ‘difficult-to-express’ proteins such as those found in, or associated with, membranes, and the poor growth of the expression hosts, which may relate to toxicity of heterologous proteins \cite{Kimelman2012-cu} (see \cite{Berlec2013-mb,Rosano2014-oq} for detailed reviews). Despite these issues, mRNA abundance can only explain up to 40\% of the variation in protein abundance, due to the complexity of translation and turnover of biomolecules \cite{Abreu2009-zf,Hanson2018-ge,Lim2018-rq,Stevens2013-hu,Schwanhausser2011-po,Bernstein2002-gg,Taniguchi2010-uq}. Furthermore, strong promoters used in expression vectors do not always lead to a desirable level of protein expression because of leaky expression \cite{Rosano2014-oq}.

For \textit{Escherichia coli}, mainstream models that may explain the lower-than-expected correlation between mRNA and protein levels are codon-usage and mRNA structure. Codon analysis is based on the frequency of codon usage in highly expressed proteins using codon adaptation index (CAI) \cite{Sharp1987-ed} or tRNA adaptation index (tAI) \cite{Reis2004-dl,Sabi2014-je}, whereas mRNA folding analysis predicts the stability of mRNA secondary structures. Codon usage bias is thought to correlate with tRNA abundance, translation efficiency and protein production \cite{Sharp1987-ed,Gutman1989-pn,Reis2004-dl,Sabi2014-je,Brule2017-mx,Osterman2020-vb,Verma2019-gh} but its usefulness has been questioned \cite{Kudla2009-tl,Plotkin2011-ak,Boel2016-jd,Cambray2018-kn}. More recent studies show stronger support for models based on mRNA folding, in which the stability of RNA structures around the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and translation initiation sites inversely correlates with protein expression \cite{De_Smit1990-xy,Kudla2009-tl,Plotkin2011-ak,Dvir2013-lq,Tuller2015-ts,Cambray2018-kn}. We recently proposed a third model in which the avoidance of inappropriate interactions between mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has a strong effect on protein expression \cite{Umu2016-zq}. The roles of these models in protein expression is an active area of research.

The algorithms for gene optimisation sample synonymous protein-coding sequences using ‘fitness’ models based on CAI, tAI, mRNA folding, and/or G+C content (\%) \cite{Villalobos2006-nx,Salis2009-dh,Raab2010-eg,Chung2012-zh,Terai2016-vp}. However, these ‘fitness’ models are usually based on some of the above findings that rely on either endogenous proteins, reporter proteins, or a few heterologous proteins with their synonymous variants. It is unclear whether these features are generalisable to explain the expression of all heterologous proteins. To address this question, we studied multiple large datasets across species in order to extract features that allow us to predict the outcomes of 11,430 experiments of recombinant protein expression in \textit{E. coli}. With this information, we propose how such features can be exploited to fine-tune protein expression at a low cost.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Accessibility of translation initiation sites strongly correlates with protein abundance}
To identify a better energetic model for mRNA structure that explains protein expression, we examined an \textit{E. coli} expression dataset of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused in-frame with a library of 96-nt upstream sequences (N=244,000 variants) \cite{Cambray2018-kn}. These 96-nt sequences were randomly generated to achieve a full factorial design by varying A+T content (\%), CAI, codon ramp bottleneck position and strength, hydrophobicity of the encoded peptide, and MFEs. We removed the redundancy of these 96-nt upstream sequences by clustering on sequence similarity, giving rise to 14,425 representative sequences. We calculated the accessibility (also known as ‘opening energy’ based on unpairing probability) for all the corresponding sub-sequences (see Methods). We examined the correlation between the opening energies and GFP levels. We found that the opening energies of translation initiation sites, in particular from the nucleotide positions $−30$ to $18$ ($−30:18$), shows the highest correlation with protein abundance (Fig \ref{fig:tisigner_fig1}A; Spearman’s correlation, $R_s = -0.65$, $P < 2.20 \times 10^{-16}$). This is stronger than the highest correlation between the minimum free energy $−30:30$ and protein abundance, which was previously reported as the highest ranked feature (Fig \ref{fig:tisigner_fig1}A; $R_s = 0.51$, $P < 2.20 \times 10^{-16}$). To account for multiple-testing, the P-values were adjusted using Bonferroni's correction and reported to machine precision. The datasets used and results are summarised in Supplementary Table S4.

For this analysis, we used a representative GFP expression dataset from Cambray et al. (2018).

We repeated the analysis for a dataset of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression in \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} \cite{Dvir2013-lq}. This dataset corresponds to a library of $5^{\prime}$ UTR variants, in which the 10-nt sequences preceding the YFP translation initiation site were randomly substituted (N=2,041 variants). In this case, the opening energy $−7:89$ showed a stronger correlation with protein abundance than that of the minimum free energy $−15:50$ reported previously (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig1}B; $R_s=−0.55$ versus $0.46$).

To examine the usefulness of accessibility in complex eukaryotes, we analysed a dataset of GFP expression in \textit{Mus musculus} \cite{Noderer2014-ve}. The reporter library was originally designed to measure the strength of translation initiation sequence context, in which all possible substitutions were made at the flanking regions of the GFP translation initiation site (6-nt upstream region and 2-nt downstream region of initiation codon; N=65,536 variants). Here the opening energy $−8:11$ showed a maximum correlation with expressed proteins, which again, is stronger than that of the minimum free energy $−30:30$ (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig1}C; $R_s=−0.28$ versus $0.12$). 

Taken together, our findings suggest that the accessibility of translation initiation sites strongly correlates with protein abundance across species. Interestingly, our findings also suggest that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence \cite{Shine1974-kl} at $−13:−8$ should be accessible to recruit ribosomes.

\subsection{Accessibility predicts the outcome of recombinant protein expression}
We investigated how accessibility performs in the real world in prediction of recombinant protein expression. For this purpose, we analysed 11,430 expression experiments in \textit{E. coli} from the ‘Protein Structure Initiative:Biology’ (PSI:Biology) \cite{Chen2004-cp,Seiler2014-on,Acton2005-ng}. These PSI:Biology targets were expressed using the pET21\_NESG expression vector that harbours the T7lac inducible promoter and a C-terminal His tag \cite{Acton2005-ng}.

We split the experimental results of the PSI:Biology targets into protein expression ‘success’ and ‘failure’ groups that were previously curated by DNASU (N=8,780 and 2,650, respectively; see Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S7}). These PSI:Biology targets span more than 189 species and the failures are representative of various problems in heterologous protein expression. Only 1.6\% of the targets were \textit{E. coli} proteins, which is negligible (N=179; see Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S7}).

We calculated the opening energies for all possible sub-sequences of the PSI:Biology targets as above (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}, positions relative to initiation codons). For each sub-sequence region, we used the opening energies to predict the expression outcomes and computed the prediction accuracy using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC; see \ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}C). A closer look into the correlations between opening energies and expression outcomes, and AUC scores calculated for the sub-sequence regions reveals a strong accessibility signal of translation initiation sites (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}B and C, Cambray’s GFP and PSI:Biology datasets, respectively). We matched the correlations and AUC scores by sub-sequence regions and confirmed that sub-sequence regions that have strong correlations are likely to have high AUC scores (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}D). In contrast, the sub-sequence regions that have zero correlations are not useful for predicting the expression outcomes (AUC approximately 0.5).

We then asked how accessibility manifests in the endogenous mRNAs of \textit{E. coli}, for which we studied a proteomics dataset of 3,725 proteins available from PaxDb \cite{Wang2015-ky}. As expected, we observed a similar accessibility signal, with the region −25:16 correlated the most with protein abundance (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}E). However, the correlation was rather low ($R_s=−0.17$, $P<2.2 \times 10^{-16}$), which may reflect the limitation of mass spectrometry to detect lower abundances \cite{Tabb2009-ek,Nilsson2010-ol}. Furthermore, the endogenous promoters have variable strength, which gives rise to a broad range of mRNA and protein levels \cite{Deuschle1986-oz,Delvigne2017-vm}. Taken together, our results show that the accessibility signal of translation initiation sites is very consistent across various datasets analysed (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S6} and \ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}).

\subsection{Accessibility outperforms other features in prediction of recombinant protein expression}
To choose an accessibility region for subsequent analyses, we selected the top 200 regions from the above correlation analysis on Cambray’s GFP dataset (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}B) and used random forest to rank their Gini importance scores in prediction of the outcomes of the PSI:Biology targets. The region $−24:24$ was ranked first, which is nearly identical to the region $−23:24$ with the top AUC score (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig2}C, AUC=0.70). We therefore used the opening energy at the region $−24:24$ in subsequent analyses.

We asked how the other features perform compared to accessibility in prediction of heterologous protein expression, for which we analysed the same PSI:Biology dataset. We first calculated the minimum free energy and avoidance at the regions −30:30 and 1:30, respectively. These are the local features associated with translation initiation rate. We also calculated CAI \cite{Sharp1987-ed}, tAI \cite{Tuller2010-ub}, codon context (CC) \cite{Ang2016-rv}, G+C content, and I$\chi$nos scores \cite{Tunney2018-sr}. CC is similar to CAI except it takes codon-pairs into account, whereas the I$\chi$nos scores are translation elongation rates predicted using a neural network model trained with ribosome profiling data (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S8}). These are the global features associated with translation elongation rate. We built a random forest model to rank the Gini importance scores of these local and global features. The local features ranked higher than the global features (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig3}A). We then calculated and compared the prediction accuracy of these features. The AUC scores for the local features were 0.70, 0.67 and 0.62 for the opening energy, minimum free energy and avoidance, respectively, whereas the global features were 0.58, 0.57, 0.54, 0.54 and 0.51 for I$\chi$nos, G+C content, CAI, CC and tAI, respectively (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig3}B). The local features outperform the global features, suggesting that effects on translation initiation are a major predictor of the outcome of heterologous protein expression. We further examined the local G+C contents corresponding to the local features (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S9}). The G+C contents in the regions $−24:24$ and $−30:30$ weakly correlate with opening energy and minimum free energy, respectively. The AUC scores for these local G+C contents are also lower than the corresponding local features, suggesting that these local G+C contents are not good proxies for the corresponding local features. Overall, our findings support previous reports that the effects on translation initiation are rate-limiting \cite{Kudla2009-tl,Tuller2015-ts} which, interestingly, correlate with the binary outcome of recombinant protein expression (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig3}C). Importantly, accessibility outperformed all other features.

\end{figure}




To identify a good opening energy threshold, we calculated positive likelihood ratios for different opening energy thresholds using the cumulative frequencies of true negative, false negative, true positive and false positive derived from the above receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S12}, top panel). Meanwhile, we calculated the 95\% confidence intervals of these positive likelihood ratios using 10,000 bootstrap replicates. We reasoned that there is an upper and lower bound on translation initiation rate, therefore the relationship between translation initiation rate and accessibility is likely to follow a sigmoidal pattern. We fit the positive likelihood ratios into a four-parametric logistic regression model (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S12}). As a result, we are 95\% confident that an opening energy of 10 kcal/mol or below at the region $−24:24$ is about two times more likely to belong to the sequences which are successfully expressed than those that failed.

\subsection{Accessibility can be improved using a simulated annealing algorithm}
The above results suggest that accessibility can, in part, explain the low expression problem of heterologous protein expression. Therefore, we sought to exploit this idea for optimising gene expression. We developed a simulated annealing algorithm to maximise the accessibility at the region $−24:24$ using synonymous codon substitution (see Methods). Previous studies have found that full-length synonymous codon-substituted transgenes may produce unexpected results, such as a reduction in mRNA abundance, RNA toxicity, and/or protein misfolding \cite{Ben-Yehezkel2015-bj,Umu2016-zq,Tunney2018-sr,mittal2018codon}. Therefore, we sought to determine the minimum number of codons required for synonymous substitutions in order to achieve near-optimum accessibility. For this purpose, we used the PSI:Biology targets that failed to be expressed. We applied our simulated annealing algorithm such that synonymous substitutions can happen at any codon of the sequences except the start and stop codons, although the changes may not necessarily happen to all codons due to the stochastic nature of our optimisation algorithm (see Methods).  Next, we constrained synonymous codon substitution to the first 14 codons and applied the same procedure (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}A). Therefore, the changes may only occur at any or all of the first 14 codons. We repeated the same procedure for the first nine and also the first four codons. Thus a total of four series of codon-substituted sequences were generated. We then compared the distributions of opening energy −24:24 for these series using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (DKS; see Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}B). The distance between the distributions of the nine and full-length codon-substituted series was significantly different yet sufficiently close (DKS=0.087, P=$3.3 \times 10^{-8}$), suggesting that optimisation of the first nine codons is sufficient in most cases to achieve an optimum accessibility of translation initiation sites. We named our software Translation Initiation coding region designer (TIsigner), which by default, allows synonymous substitutions in the first nine codons.

We asked to what extent the existing gene optimisation tools modify the accessibility of translation initiation sites. For this purpose, we first submitted the PSI:Biology targets that failed to be expressed to the ExpOptimizer web server from NovoPro Bioscience (see Methods). We also optimised the PSI:Biology targets using the standalone version of Codon Optimisation OnLine (COOL) \cite{Chung2012-zh}. We found that both tools increase accessibility indirectly even though their algorithms are not specifically designed to do so. In fact, a purely random synonymous codon substitution on these PSI:Biology targets using our own script resulted in similar increases in accessibility (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}C). These results may explain some indirect benefits from the existing gene optimisation tools (i.e. any change from suboptimal is likely to be an improvement, see below).

\subsection{Low protein yields can be improved by synonymous codon changes in the vicinity of translation initiation sites}
To demonstrate that heterologous protein expression is tunable with minimum effort, we designed and tested a series of GFP reporter gene constructs. We tested 29 plasmids harbouring GFP reporter genes with synonymous changes within the first nine codons (opening energies from 5.56 to 21.68 kcal/mol; Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary Methods). GFP expression is controlled by an IPTG inducible T7lac promoter. In addition, all plasmids harbour a second reporter gene, i.e. mScarlet-I, which is controlled by the constitutive promoter from the nptII gene for aminoglycoside-3'-O-phosphotransferase of E. coli transposon Tn5 \cite{Bindels2017-ud,Schlechter2018-nj}. mScarlet-I expression was measured to correct for plasmid copy number and as a proxy for bacterial growth \cite{Schlechter2020-ab}. 

Consistent with the above results, the GFP level significantly correlates with accessibility (i.e., anti-correlates with opening energy, $R_s=−0.53$, $P=3.4\times 10^{-3}$; \ref{fig:tisigner_fig4}A). This correlation was also the strongest compared to other features. Curiously, we observed a diminishing return with opening energies lower than that of the wild-type sequence (11.68 kcal/mol). To investigate this, we simulated a protein production experiment by modelling cell growth, transcription, translation, and turnovers (see Methods). We assumed that opening energies of 12 kcal/mol or below is favourable in this model, based on our analysis of 8,780 PSI:Biology 'success' group (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}). Interestingly, our in silico coarse-grained model shows a similar protein production trend as the actual experiment (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig4}B).

We then tested this finding using the luciferase reporter of \textit{Renilla reniformis} (RLuc). Similarly, we designed a series of RLuc variants, but with opening energies below that of the wild-type sequence (5.77 to 10.38 kcal/mol; Supplementary Fig S13 and Table S5). In addition, we tested commercially designed sequences, in which sequence optimisations were performed in full-length rather than the first 9 codons. However, RLuc is poorly soluble in the BL21Star(DE3) \textit{E. coli} host (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S13}B). We observed that TIsigner (9.9 kcal/mol) and commercially optimised luciferase reporter genes produced significantly higher luminescence than the wild-type. We also found that the levels of wild-type luciferase and many variants with lower opening energies (5-7 kcal/mol) were not significantly different, likely due to poor solubility.

As both wild-type GFP and RLuc genes are strongly expressed in \textit{E. coli}, we asked whether poorly expressed proteins can be improved by increasing accessibility of translation initiation sites. We performed densitometric analysis of previously published Western blots, which include the results of a cell-free expression system using constructs harbouring a wild-type antibody fragment or archaebacterial dioxygenase and its synonymous variants (within the first six codons) \cite{Voges2004-dt}. Indeed, variants with opening energies lower than the wild-type sequences were expressed at higher levels (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S14}).

\section{Discussion}
Our findings show that the accessibility of translation initiation sites is the strongest predictor of heterologous protein expression in E. coli. Whereas previous studies have largely used minimum free energy models to define the accessibility of a region of interest \cite{Salis2009-dh,Bhattacharyya2018-zy,Nieuwkoop2019-ft,Voges2004-dt,pelletier1987involvement}. However, Terai and Asai (2020) and ourselves have independently discovered that the opening energy is a better choice for modelling accessibility \cite{Bhandari2019-tl,Terai2020-zr} (see \ref{fig:tisigner_fig1}A for example). Opening energy is an ensemble average energy that accounts for suboptimal RNA structures that are not reported by minimum free energy models by default \cite{Muckstein2006-ys,Bernhart2011-cc}. Currently, the modelling of accessibility using opening energy is largely used for the prediction of RNA-RNA intermolecular interactions, for example, as implemented in RNAup and IntaRNA \cite{Lorenz2011-rg,Mann2017-yy}. Our study has shown that this approach can be used to identify the key accessibility regions that are consistent across multiple large expression datasets. We have implemented our findings in TIsigner web server, which currently supports recombinant protein expression in \textit{E. coli} and \textit{S. cerevisiae} (optimisation regions $−24:24$ and $−7:89$, respectively; see \ref{fig:tisigner_fig1}). An independent yet similar implementation is available in XenoExpressO web server with the purpose of optimising protein expression for an \textit{E. coli} cell-free system \cite{Zayni2018-wc}. The authors showed that an increase in accessibility of a 30 bp region from the Shine-Dalgarno sequence enhances the expression level of human voltage dependent anion channel, which further supports our findings.

The strengths of our approaches are five-fold. Firstly, the likelihood of success or failure can be assessed prior to running an experiment. Users can compare the opening energies calculated for the input and optimised sequences and the distributions of the ‘success’ and ‘failure’ of the PSI:Biology targets. We also introduced a scoring scheme to score the input and optimised sequences based upon how likely they are to be expressed (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S12}; see also Methods). Secondly, optimised sequences can have up to the first nine codons substituted (by default), meaning that gene optimisation using a standard PCR cloning method is feasible. For cloning, we propose a nested PCR approach, in which the final PCR reaction utilises a forward primer designed according to the optimised sequence \cite{Sambrook2001-ki} (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}D). Thirdly, the cost of gene optimisation can be reduced dramatically as gene synthesis is replaced with PCR using our approach. This enables high-throughput protein expression screening using the optimised sequences, generated at a low cost. Fourthly, tunable expression is possible, i.e. high, intermediate or even low expression $5^{\prime}$ codon sequences can be designed, allowing for more control over heterologous protein production, as demonstrated by our experiments (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig4}). Finally, our fast, lightweight, coarse-grained simulation approach has opened up new avenues to study several aspects of gene expression, such as transcription, translation, cellular growth, and turnovers, which give good proxies to how cellular systems behave.


\section{Material and methods}
\subsection{Plasmids}
Plasmids were constructed using the MIDAS Golden Gate cloning system (see Supplementary Methods, Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S1}, \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S2}, \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S3}, \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S4}, \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S5}, and Table \ref{tab:appendix_TIsigner_T1}, \ref{tab:appendix_TIsigner_T2}, \ref{tab:appendix_TIsigner_T3}) \cite{Van_Dolleweerd2018-sg}.

\subsection{Data}
Datasets used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S4. These include fluorescence reporter expression datasets previously generated using E. coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Mus musculus cultured cells (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S6}), and recombinant protein production dataset from the Protein Structure Initiative: Biology (PSI:Biology; Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S7}). Two ribosome profiling libraries previously generated using \textit{E. coli} were retrieved from the Sequence Read Archive (SRR7759806 and SRR7759807) \cite{Mohammad2019-gf}.

\subsection{Sequence features analysis}
Representative sequences were chosen using CD-HIT-EST \cite{Li2006-qp,Fu2012-ng}. Minimum free energies, opening energies and avoidance were calculated using RNAfold, RNAplfold and RNAup from ViennaRNA package (version 2.4.11), respectively \cite{Hofacker1994-vu,Muckstein2006-ys,Bernhart_undated-tw,Bompfunewerer2008-tm,Lorenz2011-rg,Bernhart2011-cc,Lorenz2016-ie}. RNAfold was run with default parameters. For RNAplfold, sub-sequences were generated from the input sequences to calculate opening energies (using the parameters -W 210 -u 210). For RNAup, we examined the stochastic interactions between the region 1:30 of each mRNA and 54 non-coding RNAs (using the parameters -b -o). RNAup reports the total interaction between two RNAs as the sum of energy required to open accessible sites in the interacting molecules Gu and the energy gained by subsequent hybridisation Gh\cite{Muckstein2006-ys}. For the interactions between each mRNA and 54 non-coding RNAs, we chose the most stable mRNA:ncRNA pair to report an inappropriate mRNA:ncRNA interaction, i.e. the pair with the strongest hybridisation energy, (Gh)min. 

CAI, tAI and Codon Context (CC) were calculated using the reference weights from Sharp and Li \cite{Sharp1987-ed}, Tuller et al. \cite{Tuller2010-ub} and Ang et al. \cite{Ang2016-rv}, respectively. Translation elongation rate was predicted using I$\chi$nos \cite{Tunney2018-sr} that were trained using the \textit{E. coli} ribosome profiling data (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S8}). Local G+C contents were also examined (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S9}).

\subsection{Coarse-grained simulation}
To understand the dynamics between accessibility and protein production, we performed a coarse grained simulation using constructs with increasing opening energy on a simulated cellular system. Despite being less precise than fine grained methods such as ab initio and molecular dynamics, coarse grained simulations often give similar results, with an added advantage of being scalable to very large systems.

To set the simulation, we binned the opening energies between 2 and 32 in intervals of two, with each bin representing a ‘reporter plasmid construct’ whose opening energy is the mean of the bin. For each construct, the ‘technical replicates’ were generated by allowing slight variations on the mean opening energy of the bin. This is to model variation between replicates, and the discrepancies between the estimated and the actual opening energies in vivo. For each round of transcription, mRNA copies were randomly generated from 30 to 60 plasmid DNA copies \cite{Held2003-ts,Gomes2020-ek,Rosano2014-oq}. We chose an optimum opening energy of 12 kcal/mol or less for translation (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}). However, this is probabilistic which occasionally allowed protein production from higher opening energy transcripts. We allowed mRNA to decay probabilistically when a mRNA molecule is translated for more than 10 rounds.

We also set a threshold of protein tolerance to be 1,000,000 copies where the copy numbers of endogenous proteins are usually less than 10,000 \cite{Taniguchi2010-uq}, beyond which there is a sporadic death of cells. However, in this simulation, the chances of staying viable and reproducing are higher than death, and cells grow steadily. This threshold also simulated random but low cell deaths in the experiment, without setting an extra variable.

To limit the computational complexity, our coarse-grained simulations used lower constants and iterations. Initialising with 100 cells, the algorithm was set to terminate either after 10,000 iterations or when the total number of  cells becomes zero. After termination, the total number of proteins and cells for each construct were taken from the endpoints. To imitate ‘biological replicates’, we repeated the above simulation three times with different random numbers, which provides slightly different initial conditions for each experiment.

\subsection{Development of Translation Initiation coding region designer (TIsigner)}
Finding a synonymous sequence with a maximum accessibility is a combinatorial problem that spans a vast search space. For example, for a protein-coding sequence of nine codons, assuming an average of 3 synonymous codons per amino acid, we can expect a total of 19,682 unique synonymous coding sequences. This number increases rapidly with increasing numbers of codons. Heuristic optimisation approaches are preferred in such situations because the search space can be explored more efficiently to obtain nearly optimal solutions. 

To optimise the accessibility of a given sequence, TIsigner uses a simulated annealing algorithm \cite{Kirkpatrick1983-hh,Ingber2000-aw,Keith2002-jx,Brownlee2011-bk}, a heuristic optimisation technique based on the thermodynamics of a system settling into a low energy state after cooling. Simulated annealing algorithms have been used to solve many combinatorial optimisation problems in bioinformatics. For example, we previously applied this algorithm to align and predict non-coding RNAs from multiple sequences \cite{Lindgreen2007-jy}. Other studies use this algorithm to find consensus sequences \cite{Keith2002-jx}, optimise ribosome binding sites \cite{Salis2009-dh} and predict mRNA foldings \cite{Gaspar2013-bg} using minimum free energy models.

% According to statistical mechanics, the probability pi of a system occupying energy state Ei,with temperatureT, follows a Boltzmann distribution of the form e-Ei/T, which gives a set of probability mass functions along every point i in the solution space.  Using a Markov chain sampling, these probabilities are sampled such that each point has a lower temperature than the previous one. As the system is cooled from high to low temperatures (T0), the samples converge to a minimum of E, which in many cases will be the global minimum \cite{Keith2002-jx}. A frequently used Markov chain sampling technique is Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in which a ‘bad’ moveE2 from initial state E1 such that E2 >E1, is accepted if  R(0,1)  p2/ p1, where R(0,1) is a uniformly random number between 0 and 1.

In our implementation, each iteration consists of a move that may involve multiple synonymous codon substitutions. The algorithm begins at a high temperature where the first move is drastic, synonymous substitutions occur in all replaceable codons. At the end of the first iteration, a new sequence is accepted if the opening energy is smaller than that of the input sequence. However, if the opening energy of a new sequence is greater than that of the input sequence, acceptance depends on the Metropolis-Hastings criteria. The accepted sequence is used for the next iteration, which repeats the above process. As the temperature cools, the moves get milder with fewer synonymous codon changes (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S10}). Simulated annealing stops upon reaching a near-optimum solution. 

For the web version of TIsigner, the default number of replaceable codons is restricted to the first nine codons. However, this default setting can be reset to range from the first four to nine codons, or the full length of the coding sequence. Since the accessibility of a fixed region is optimised, this process only takes O(1) time (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S11}). Furthermore, TIsigner runs multiple simulated annealing instances, in parallel, to obtain multiple possible sequence solutions.

When users select T7lac promoter as the $5^{\prime}$ UTR, they can adjust ‘Expression Score’, that is calculated based on the PSI:Biology dataset (see below). This allows them to tune the expression level of a target gene. In contrast, when users input a custom $5^{\prime}$ UTR sequence, they only have the option to either maximise or minimise expression.

To implement ‘Expression Score’, the posterior probabilities of success for input and optimised sequences are evaluated using the following equations from Bayesian statistics:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
positive\ posterior\ odds &= prior\ odds \times fitted\ positive\ likelihood\ ratio \\
positive\ posterior\ probability &= \frac{ positive\ posterior\ odds}{1 + positive posterior odds}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}


The fitted positive likelihood ratios were obtained from the following 4-parametric logistic regression equation:
\begin{equation*}
fitted\ positive\ likelihood\ ratio = d + \frac{(a-d)}{1+(\frac{positive\ likelihood\ ratio}{c})^b}
\end{equation*}

with parameters a, b, c, and d. The prior probability was set to 0.49, which is the proportion of ‘Expressed’ (N=21,046) divided by ‘Cloned’ (N=42,774) of the PSI:Biology targets reported as of 28 June 2017 (http://targetdb.rcsb.org/metrics/). Posterior probabilities were scaled as percentages to score the input and optimised sequences (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S12}).

The presence of terminator-like elements \cite{Chen2013-um} in the protein-coding region may result in expression of truncated mRNAs due to early transcription termination. Therefore, we implemented an optional check for putative terminators in the input and optimised sequences by cmsearch (INFERNAL version 1.1.2) \cite{Nawrocki2013-te} using the covariance models of terminators from RMfam \cite{Gardner2015-ui,Kalvari2018-un}. We also allow users to filter the output sequences for the presence of restriction sites. Restriction modification sites (AarI, BsaI, and BsmBI) are avoided by default.

Besides \textit{E. coli}, users can choose \textit{S. cerevisiae}, \textit{M. musculus} or ‘Other’ as the expression host. The regions for optimising accessibility are $−7:89$, $−8:11$ and $−24:89$ for \textit{S. cerevisiae}, \textit{M. musculus} and ‘Other’, respectively (\ref{fig:tisigner_fig1} and Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S6}). When users choose ‘Custom’ for expression host, the region for optimising accessibility becomes customisable.

\subsection{Sequence optimisation}
We submitted the PSI:Biology targets that failed to be expressed (N=2,650) to the ExpOptimizer web server from NovoPro Bioscience (https://www.novoprolabs.com/\\tools/codon-optimization). A total of 2,573 sequences were optimised. The target sequences were also optimised using a local version of COOL \cite{Chung2012-zh} and TIsigner using default settings. We also ran a random synonymous codon substitution as a control for these 2,573 sequences.

\subsection{GFP assay}
BL21(DE3)pLysS competent \textit{E. coli} cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with plasmids and grown overnight on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing spectinomycin (50 $\mu g/ml$) and chloramphenicol (25 $\mu g/ml$). Single colonies were picked and inoculated into 3 ml LB broth containing the same antibiotics, and cultures were grown for 18 hours at 37$^{\circ}$C, 200 rpm. Cultures were diluted with fresh media at 1:20 and grown at 37$^{\circ}$C, 200 rpm, until reaching the mid-logarithmic growth phase (optical densities at 600 nm ($OD_{600}$) of ~0.3). Of each culture, 20 $\mu l$ was seeded into 96-well plates containing 180 $\mu l$  LB broth supplemented with antibiotics and isopropyl-$\beta$-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mM final concentration) per well. Fluorescence intensities and ODs were measured in a black, flat, clear bottom 96-well plate with lid (CELLSTAR, Greiner) using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech) equipped with an excitation filter (band pass 485-12) and an emission filter (band pass 520) for GFP and excitation filter (band pass 484) and an emission filter (band pass 610-10) for mScarlet-I. The plate was incubated at 37$^{\circ}$C with “meander corner well shaking” at 300 rpm for 7 hours measuring fluorescence and ODs every 10 minutes. Fluorescence was measured in a 2 mm circle recording the average of 8 measurements per well. Average values of technical replicates were calculated and normalised to the mScarlet-I second reporter, and then to the normalised value of the GFP variant with the highest opening energy (21.68 kcal/mol). Normalised fluorescence values were obtained from the average values of biological replicates (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S13} and Table S5).

\subsection{Luciferase assay}
BL21Star(DE3) competent cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with plasmids and grown overnight at 37$^{\circ}$C on LB agar plates containing 50 $\mu g/ml$ spectinomycin. Single colonies were picked and inoculated into 5 ml LB broth (50 $\mu g/ml$ spectinomycin) and grown for 18 hours at 37$^{\circ}$C, 200 rpm. Bacterial cultures were diluted with fresh media at 1:20 and grown at 37$^{\circ}$C, 200 rpm, up to a mid-logarithmic phase ($OD_{600}$ of ~0.4). The cultures were split and induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 0.25 mM (or uninduced as controls), and seeded into a white, flat, clear bottom 96-well white plate with lid (Costar, Corning), 150 $\mu l$ per well, in triplicates. Cells were incubated in a FLUOstar Omega Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH) for 90 minutes at 25$^{\circ}$C, 200 rpm, and $OD_{600}$ was measured every 15 minutes (over 7 cycles). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at $3000 \times g$, for 10 minutes, at 20$^{\circ}$C. Supernatants were removed. As the substrate can penetrate into cells, 50 $\mu l$ of coelenterazine h (Promega) was added to living cells to minimise sample processing steps and variability \cite{Lorenz1996-kh,Fuhrmann2004-by}. Luminescence was measured ($\lambda_{em} = 475 nm$) in a Clariostar microplate reader (BMG LABTECH) at 25$^{\circ}$C every 2 minutes (over 11 cycles). Average values of technical replicates were calculated and normalised to the wild-type. Normalised luminescence values were obtained from the average values of biological replicates (Supplementary Fig \ref{fig:appendix_TIsigner_S14} and Supplementary Table S5).

\subsection{Statistical analysis}
AUC and Gini importance scores were calculated using scikit-learn (version 0.20.2) \cite{Pedregosa2011-cd}. The 95\% confidence intervals for AUC scores were calculated using DeLong’s method \cite{DeLong1988-oo}. Spearman’s correlation coefficients and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics were calculated using Pandas (version 0.23.4) \cite{McKinney2010-rg} and scipy (version 1.2.1) \cite{Oliphant2007-za,Millman2011-tt}, respectively. Positive likelihood ratios with 95\% confidence intervals were calculated using the bootLR package \cite{Marill2017-qb,R_Core_Team2019-kt}. The P-values of multiple testing were adjusted using Bonferroni's correction and reported to machine precision. Plots were generated using Matplotlib (version 3.0.2) \cite{noauthor_undated-nq} and Seaborn (version 0.9.0) \cite{Waskom2018-dp}.
