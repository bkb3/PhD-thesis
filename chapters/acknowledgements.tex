%Firstly, I want to thank somebody, and somebody else.\footnote{Here is a footnote} Here is another thing.
I would like to thank my supervisor Ass. Prof. Paul P Gardner as well as 'unofficial' co-supervisor, Dr Chun Shen Lim for their guidance, feedback, ideas, time, encouragement and humurous chats. 

I am grateful to the committee members Ass. Prof. Chris Brown and Senior Lecturer Dr Alex Gavryushkin for many feedbacks along the way.
