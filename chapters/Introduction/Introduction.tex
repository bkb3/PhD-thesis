% Human civilisation has used microbes and cell cultures since at least the Neolithic for fermentation \cite{liu2018fermented}. 
After the introduction of recombinant protein production in 1977 \cite{itakura1977expression}, a large number of monoclonal antibodies, hormones, enzymes and other proteins of pharmaceutical, industrial and scientific importance are being synthesised using microbes such as bacteria and yeast, insect cells and mammalian cells. Consequently, recombinant proteins currently has a market value in billions of dollars, making it one of the highly valued technologies \cite{walsh2014biopharmaceutical, puetz2019recombinant}. 


There has been much research to improve the recombinant protein production technology. In particular, the development of the pET vector system in 1991 has revolutionised the use of \textit{Escherichia coli} for protein production \cite{dubendorf1991controlling}. \textit{E. coli} is often the host of choice because it is relatively inexpensive, and has a faster growth rate than other expression hosts \cite{Rosano2014-oq, demain2009production}. Now there are a multitude of optimised vectors such as pGEX, pMAL and pET as well as a number of engineered strains of \textit{E. coli} such as BL21 and BL21(D3). Several guidelines and practices have also been proposed to maximise the chances of successful experiments \cite{Berlec2013-mb, Rosano2014-oq}. Furthermore, several high-throughput methods have made the process scalable \cite{stevens2000design, braun2003high, jia2016high}. These new advancements has made the process of recombinant protein production much easier and economical. 


\section{Recombinant protein production}
The initial step in recombinant protein production is a successful protein expression. The expressed protein then needs to be soluble for use in many structural, functional and pharmaceutical studies where concentrated protein samples are desired \cite{Kramer2012-wk, Hou2018-yd}. Despite almost 40 years of refinements in protocols and technology, around half of the recombinant protein expression experiments fail at the expression stage and nearly half of expressed protein are insoluble \cite{targetdbmetrices} (Figure \ref{fig:fail_succ}). This makes the protein production process more challenging. Predicting protein expression and solubility can help plan the experiment and save time and resources. Furthermore, using a highly optimised target gene can increase the success rate of recombinant protein production.
