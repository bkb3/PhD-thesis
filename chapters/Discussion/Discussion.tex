Recombinant protein production is widely used in scientific research and industry, due to a very straightforward procedure. However, in general, the success rate of these experiments is around a quarter, which is attributed to protein expression and solubility. In this work, we studied the major factors affecting these two steps and used the findings to develop methods to optimise the protein production. In addition, since many recombinant proteins of interest are secretory, translocation efficiency also plays an important role in the final yield. Since protein translocation is usually done by signal peptides, fusing appropriate signal peptide to the protein of interest increases the yield. These signal peptides are often part of the plasmid, hence mature peptide is used in cloning. Therefore, we also developed tool to predict the presence of signal peptide in the sequence and identify the mature peptide. 

\section{Optimising protein expression using TIsigner (Translation Initiation coding region designer)}
We have demonstrated the mRNA accessibility is a better predictor of protein expression across several datasets (\ref{tab:Summary_of_TIsigner_and_SoDoPE}). Therefore, we used this feature to develop, TIsigner (\href{https://tisigner.com/tisigner}{https://tisigner.com/tisigner}), a tool for optimising protein expression. TIsigner also uses simulated annealing algorithm to provide a novel mechanism for tuning the protein expression from low to high levels. Other unique features include an estimation of protein expression of mRNA sequences, which is named as 'expression score' and synonymous changes limited to the first 10 codons of the input sequence. TIsigner's synonymous substitution algorithm is designed to make minimal number of changes. This approach is advantageous because of two reasons\textemdash first, it is possible to do a PCR cloning using the optimised part as primers, which in turn reduces the cost of experiment significantly as compared to the conventional full gene synthesis method and second, it reduces the possibility of generating toxic mRNA sequences. mRNA toxicity is still a difficult problem to address and the mechanisms of toxicity are not fully understood yet \cite{mittal2018codon}. However, TIsigner also offers a possibility to do synonymous changes over all codons, which might be useful if terminators are found. The web-version of TIsigner automatically suggests doing a full length substitution if any terminators are found (Figure \ref{fig:terminator_prompt}).

\section{Optimising protein solubility using SoDoPE (Soluble Domains for Protein Expression)}
Almost all use cases of protein require it to be soluble. Hence, optimising just the protein expression is not sufficient for a better protein production. Based on protein structural flexibility, which is the most accurate predictor of solubility among all conventional features, we developed a new metric called the Solubility-Weighted Index (SWI). SWI is a very accurate predictor of solubility and outperforms other tools (Table: \ref{tab:Summary_of_TIsigner_and_SoDoPE}). Using SWI, we developed a solubility prediction and optimisation tool, SoDoPE (\href{https://tisigner.com/sodope}{https://tisigner.com/sodope}). SoDoPE is an unparalleled tool with a distinctive interface for an easy navigation of protein sequence/domains with real-time solubility prediction and optimisation. The effect of different solubility tags on solubility can also be compared to pick the best one for experiment.


\section{Detection of signal peptides using Razor}
The presence of signal peptides should almost always be checked when planning the expression experiments for uncharacterised proteins. Based on the properties of signal sequences, we developed Razor to detect the presence of N-terminal signal peptides. Compared to other related tools, Razor also predicts toxin and fungi\textemdash specific SPs. These would be helpful for users in choosing the expression and purification systems that prevent the harmful intracellular accumulation of recombinant secretory proteins/toxins. The performance summary of Razor is given in Table \ref{tab:Summary_of_Razor}.



\section{Reception of tools by the community}
TISIGNER (\href{https://tisigner.otago.ac.nz}{https://tisigner.otago.ac.nz}) is the web-suite of these tools. Initially, it consisted of TIsigner only, hence the name, but has been expanded to include both SoDoPE and Razor. Our tool was online since February 2020. Despite the short period (December 2020 at the time of writing), our tools are gaining traction among researchers worldwide, with an exponential increase in the numbers of visitors from many countries (Figure \ref{fig:tisigner_stats}).

\section{Outlook}
So far, the present work tried to enumerate some of the cellular level process responsible in protein synthesis. In this section, we will briefly do a simplified version of higher level modelling by taking into account of the production system as a black-box (S) which has various noise and uncertainties. In such a crowded environment, there might be some, possibly unknown, additional constrains and feedback among the cells or within the cells itself, which could stabilise or destabilise the production system. Let us represent these any and all of these uncertainties, noises and feedbacks collectively by a black-box (F) and simply refer to as feedbacks. A stable system is a result of interplay between the system and its feedback. These type of systems are called \textit{control systems} (Figure \ref{fig:control_system}A). The behaviour of output of these systems when the input is switched from low to high is studied within the framework of step response.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]

\caption[Different possible step responses of a stable control system when input is switched from low to high.]{\textbf{Different possible step responses of a stable control system when input is switched from low to high. (A)} A control system (S) with a feedback loop (F). This system is assumed to be stable. \textbf{(B)} Output (step response) when the damping effects due to feedback (F) are low, equal and high compared to the system (S). Evolution parameter is an arbitrary parameter of the system.}%the List of Figures because of the *}
\label{fig:control_system}
\end{figure}

In control theory, the evolution of higher order system with respect to some evolution parameter (often time, but could be any other variable) is approximated by a second order ordinary differential equation: 
\begin{equation}
    \Ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_n\dot{x} + \omega_n^2 x = 0
\end{equation}
where $\omega_n$ is the eigen frequency, $\zeta$ is the damping ratio. The eigen frequency is the frequency at with system oscillates when no external forces are present, whereas damping ratio is an indicative of the relative strength of feedback to the system (F/S). The most general solution of this equation can be written as a linear combination:
\begin{equation}
    x = Ce^{-\omega_n(\zeta + i\sqrt{1-\zeta^2})} + De^{-\omega_n(\zeta - i\sqrt{1-\zeta^2})}
\end{equation}

Hence for any system, multiple possibilities exist for the output which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:control_system}B. For $0 \leq \zeta < 1 $, the output is decaying exponential with oscillations and is called underdamped. For $\zeta > 1$, the system does not oscillate and is called overdamped whereas for $\zeta = 1$, the system is logistic in nature and is called critically damped.

Ideally, physical systems with $\zeta = 1$ (critically damped) are preferred because the maximum output can be reached easily. In contrast, biological systems are often noisy, which could make the output behave like either of the cases we discussed. Consequently, despite feeding \textit{better} inputs, the output may not always be as predicted. As an illustration, the data from Cambray \textit{et al.} \cite{Cambray2018-kn}, follows an overdamped trend ($\zeta > 1$), which suggests that the feedback in their system were stronger than the system (Figure \ref{fig:refitting_data_cambray}). In this case, the output always keeps increasing with better inputs. However, the results of our GFP experiments using TIsigner, fits better to the underdamped system ($0 \leq \zeta < 1 $) than a logistic regression (critically damped), suggesting that the unknown feedbacks within our system were less than that of the system (Figure \ref{fig:refitting_data_tisigner}). In this case, the output tends to oscillate when the input is increased beyond a certain limit, which we observed (Figure \ref{fig:refitting_data_tisigner}C).

 These inherent and inevitable feedbacks and constrains, for example protein toxicity and solubility issues, may be different for different systems, protein of interest and protocols. Hence, a more rigorous and detailed analysis, which takes into account of all of these variables may be required to explain the outcomes of recombinant protein production systems with a greater accuracy.
